//! Range measurement basestation
//!
//! This is a tag acting as a base station, collecting distances to mobile tags.
//!
//! The anchor/tag example does the distance calculation *at the tag* which is less useful for applications where
//! the tags are very "dumb".
//!
//! Instead, the basestation intiates the ranging request and records the distance over defmt.
