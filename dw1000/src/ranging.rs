//! Implementation of double-sided two-way ranging
//!
//! This ranging technique is described in the DW1000 user manual, section 12.3.
//! This module uses three messages for a range measurement, as described in
//! section 12.3.2.
//!
//! This module defines the messages required, and provides code for sending and
//! decoding them. It is left to the user to tie all that together, by sending
//! out the messages at the right time.
//!
//! There can be some variation in the use of this module, depending on the use
//! case. Here is one example of how this module can be used:
//! 1. Nodes are divided into anchors and tags. Tags are those nodes whose
//!    position interests us. Anchors are placed in known locations to enable
//!    range measurements.
//! 2. Anchors regularly send out pings ([`Ping`]).
//! 3. Tags listen for these pings, and reply with a ranging request
//!    ([`Request`]) for each ping they receive.
//! 4. When an anchor receives a ranging request, it replies with a ranging
//!    response ([`Response`]).
//! 5. Once the tag receives the ranging response, it has all the information it
//!    needs to compute the distance.
//!
//! Please refer to the [examples] in the DWM1001 Board Support Crate for an
//! implementation of this scheme.
//!
//! In this scheme, anchors initiate the exchange, which results in the tag
//! having the distance information. Possible variations include the tag
//! initiating the request and the anchor calculating the distance, or a
//! peer-to-peer scheme without dedicated tags and anchors.
//!
//! Please note that using the code in this module without further processing of
//! the result will yield imprecise measurements. To improve the precision of
//! those measurements, a range bias needs to be applied. Please refer to the
//! user manual, and [this DWM1001 issue] for more information.
