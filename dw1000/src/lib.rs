//! Driver crate for the DW1000 UWB transceiver
//!
//! The recommended way to use this driver is the [high-level interface]. If you
//! require a higher degree of flexibility, you can use the
//! [register-level interface] instead.
//!
//! If you're using the DWM1001 module or DWM1001-Dev board, you probably don't
//! want to use this crate directly. Consider using the [`dwm1001`] crate
//! instead. The `dwm1001` crate also contains [usage examples] for this crate's
//! API.
//!
//! This driver is built on top of [`embedded-hal`], which means it is portable
//! and can be used on any platform that implements the `embedded-hal` API. It
//! is only well-tested on the Nordic nRF52832 microcontroller though (the
//! microcontroller used on the DWM1001 module), so be aware that you might run
//! into problems on other devices.
