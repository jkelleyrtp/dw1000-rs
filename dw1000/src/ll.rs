//! Low-level interface to the DW1000
//!
//! This module implements a register-level interface to the DW1000. Users of
//! this library should typically not need to use this. Please consider using
//! the [high-level interface] instead.
//!
//! If you're using the low-level interface because the high-level interface
//! doesn't cover your use case, please consider [filing an issue].
//!
//! **NOTE**: Many field access methods accept types that have a larger number
//! of bits than the field actually consists of. If you use such a method to
//! pass a value that is too large to be written to the field, it will be
//! silently truncated.
